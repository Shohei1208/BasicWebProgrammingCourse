## In this lesson we will learn to write your first program.

### Printing a string
The first thing we will learn to do is to print a string. A string is anything that should be treated as plain text. We signal to the computer that we using a string by adding quatation marks around our text like so `"Test goes here"`. Printing out strings is commonly used when debugging or trying to understand a program. We will talk about this more in the future. For now, let's start by greating the world with our first computer program. Write the below code.

     console.log("Hello World!");
     console.log("-Mike"); //You can put your name here

Now in your command line run `node program.js` to run your code.

Output: 

`Hello World`

`-Mike`
