## In this lesson we will learn to write your first program.

### Printing a string
The first thing we will learn to do is to print a string. A string is anything that should be treated as plain text. We signal to the computer that we using a string by adding quatation marks around our text like so `"Test goes here"`. Printing out strings is commonly used when debugging or trying to understand a program. We will talk about this more in the future. For now, let's start by greating the world with our first computer program. Write the below code.

     console.log("Hello World!");
     console.log("-Mike"); //You can put your name here

##### Note: In JavaScript you can add comments to your code by putting `//` before your comment. Comments are not run, but just give helpful context for your code to the reader.

Now in your command line run `node program.js` to run your code.

Output: 

`Hello World`

`-Mike`

### Assigning a variable
Now we will learn about variables. Variables have two parts, a name and data. The name will be used in the program to call the data. In JavaScript you can let the computer know you are creating a variable by adding the keyword `let` before the name of your variable, then add and `=` followed by the data you want to be associated with your variable. Let's see how this will work. 

     let Name = "Mike"; //You can put your name here
     console.log("Hello World!");
     console.log("-" + Name); //Here we are adding two stings together with the `+` command. The first string is specified directly, the second is called through our `Name` variable

Now in your command line run `node program.js` to run your code.

Output: 

`Hello World`

`-Mike`


### Making an array (list)
What if instead of greating the world with your program you wanted to give a brief self introduction. Next we will create an array to help us to share our name and what classes we are taking. You signal the array data type to the computer by placing comma seperated data within `[]`. You can then call each element (or data point) in the array by putting brackects with the index of the element `[0]` directly after the array. Let's try this out.

     let Name = "Mike"; //You can put your name here
     let Classes = ["JBE", "ECON", "OB1", "JLI"]; //You can put your classes here
     console.log("Hello, my name is " + Name + " and I am taking " + Classes[0] + ", " + Classes[1] + ", " + Classes[2] + ", and " + Classes[3]); 

##### Note: The index of the array starts with 0. Thus the first element in the array is at index 0.
     
Now in your command line run `node program.js` to run your code.

Output: 

`Hello my name is Mike and I am taking JBE, ECON, OB1, and JLI`


### Looping through an array
Adding the classes took some time. If you had many courses, it would be very tedious. Let's see if we can simplify this through the use of a loop. A loop itterates (moves) through an array and executes some code for each item in the array. See below.

     let Name = "Mike"; //You can put your name here
     let Classes = ["JBE", "ECON", "OB1", "JLI"]; //You can put your classes here
     let String = "Hello, my name is " + Name + " and I am taking "; //Start the initial string
     for(let Class of Classes){ //For each Class in Classes
          String += Class + ", " //Add the name of the class plus `, ` to the string.
     }
     console.log(String); 
     
Now in your command line run `node program.js` to run your code.

Output: 

`Hello my name is Mike and I am taking JBE, ECON, OB1, JLI,`
