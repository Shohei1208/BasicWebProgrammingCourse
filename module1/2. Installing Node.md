## Install Node.js
The first thing we need to do is enable us to run JavaScript on our computers. JavaScript normally is just run on web browsers like Google, but Node allows us to run JavaScript on our local computers. It also allows us to run JavaScript on servers so when creating web applications you can use JavaScript for both the front and back end of the application.

To install node:
- Go to this url: https://nodejs.org/en/ 
- Select the option for most users
- Continue through the installation process
