## Command Line
The command line is a text interface with your computer. In the Graphic User Interface most of us are accustomed to, we use our mouse to click on icons and buttons to execute all kinds of actions from creating files to running applications. In the command line you can perform the same actions but with text commands. 

#### Mac Users:
- In spotlight search, search for "Terminal" and open "Terminal". 
- Use the command `ls` to show what files and directories are in your current directory.  //`ls` is short for "list"
- Use command `cd directoryName`.  //`cd` is short for change directory  Example: `cd Desktop`
- When you are in the directory of your file run `node filename.js`

#### Windows Users:
- In the windows start menu, search for "Command Prompt" and open "Command Prompt". 
- Use the command `dir` to show what files and directories are in your current directory.  //`dir` is short for "directory"
- Use command `cd directoryName`.  //`cd` is short for change directory  Example: `cd Desktop`
- When you are in the directory of your file run `node filename.js`
