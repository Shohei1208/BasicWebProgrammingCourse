# Source Control 

Source control (or version control) is the mechanism by which we manage changes to computer code. 
It is important to have source control so that you can track changes over time and revert back to earlier stages of the code if needed. 
For example, if you make a new feature, but later discover that feature introduces security vulnerabilities, 
you can go back to the version of the code before the new feature was added.  

## Git
Git is a distributed version control system made by Linus Torvalds the creator of Linux. It is open source and allows many people to work on the same code. 
This is incredibly helpful when working in teams and allows you to merge divergent changes in an orderly manner. 
GitHub and GitLab are both hosted version control companies that use Git. 
We will use GitHub for this course as it allows us to host our code and field comments and suggestions from others. 
We will install Git and then learn how to use Git and GitHub.
