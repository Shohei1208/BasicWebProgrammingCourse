# GitHub

### Setting up GitHub
- Register for GitHub using this URL: https://github.com/join
- Follow the prompts to input your email, password, and username.
- Next create a repository by going to the card in the top left and inputting a name for the repository then clicking the green "create new reposity" 
button. For this class, it is best to create a public repository so that other classmates can see it.
- Next, click "uploading an existing file" and select the file we created last class. 
- Once you are finished, you can send me the url for your repository and I will add it to the course so others can see your code.
