# Functions
Functions can make your code much more efficient. A function consists of a name, a block of code, some inputs for that coder and an output. 
You can call that function in other parts of your program using the function name. In JavaScript, functions are created with the keyword `function`. 
Let's see how we can use a function to reuse our previous code for multiple students. 
    
  
    function Introduce(Name, Classes) {
      let String = "Hello, my name is " + Name + " and I am taking ";
      for (let Index in Classes) {
       if (Index < Classes.length - 1) {
         String += Classes[Index] + ", ";
       } else {
         String += "and " + Classes[Index] + ".";
       }
      }
      return String;
    }
  
    let myName = "Mike"; //You can put your name here
    let myClasses = ["JBE", "ECON", "OB1", "JLI"]; //You can put your classes here
    let jorgeName = "Jorge"; //You can put your friend's name here
    let jorgeClasses = ["JBE", ,"OM", "ECON", "Accounting", "OB1", "JLB"]; //You can put your friend's classes here

    console.log(Introduce(myName, myClasses));
    console.log(Introduce(jorgeName, jorgeClasses));
    
Now in your command line run node program.js to run your code.

Output:

`Hello, my name is Mike and I am taking JBE, ECON, OB1, and JLI.`

`Hello, my name is Jorge and I am taking JBE, OM, ECON, Accounting, OB1, and JLB.`


We can also put functions inside other functions and give default values to function variables. Ideally each step in your program should be a function in order to make your code more readable. Let's see how this could work.

    function AddToString(class, end=False) {
        if (end) {
            String += "and " + Classes[Index] + ".";
        } else {
            String += Classes[Index] + ", "
        }
    }
    
    function Introduce(Name, Classes) {
      let String = "Hello, my name is " + Name + " and I am taking ";
      for (let Index in Classes) {
       if (Index < Classes.length - 1) {
         AddToString(Classes[Index]);
       } else {
         AddToString(Classes[Index]);
       }
      }
      return String;
    }
  
    let myName = "Mike"; //You can put your name here
    let myClasses = ["JBE", "ECON", "OB1", "JLI"]; //You can put your classes here
    let jorgeName = "Jorge"; //You can put your friend's name here
    let jorgeClasses = ["JBE", ,"OM", "ECON", "Accounting", "OB1", "JLB"]; //You can put your friend's classes here

    console.log(Introduce(myName, myClasses));
    console.log(Introduce(jorgeName, jorgeClasses));
    
Now in your command line run node program.js to run your code.

Output:

`Hello, my name is Mike and I am taking JBE, ECON, OB1, and JLI.`

`Hello, my name is Jorge and I am taking JBE, OM, ECON, Accounting, OB1, and JLB.`


We can refactor this code to be more efficient. Can you try to make it better? Below is how I would write it.

    function AddToString(class, end=False) {
        if (end) {
            String += "and " + Classes[Index] + ".";
        } else {
            String += Classes[Index] + ", "
        }
    }
    
    function Introduce(Name, Classes) {
      let String = "Hello, my name is " + Name + " and I am taking ";
      for (let Index in Classes) {
         AddToString(Classes[Index],Index < Classes.length - 1);
      }
      return String;
    }
  
    let myName = "Mike"; //You can put your name here
    let myClasses = ["JBE", "ECON", "OB1", "JLI"]; //You can put your classes here
    let jorgeName = "Jorge"; //You can put your friend's name here
    let jorgeClasses = ["JBE", ,"OM", "ECON", "Accounting", "OB1", "JLB"]; //You can put your friend's classes here

    console.log(Introduce(myName, myClasses));
    console.log(Introduce(jorgeName, jorgeClasses));
    
Now in your command line run node program.js to run your code.

Output:

`Hello, my name is Mike and I am taking JBE, ECON, OB1, and JLI.`

`Hello, my name is Jorge and I am taking JBE, OM, ECON, Accounting, OB1, and JLB.`
